# **About kWP / KELP**

KELP began as **katWebProfissional**, a tiny web experiment.
Over time, it evolved into a **minimal macOS browser**, with a (kind of) clean UI and not so smooth interactions.

Still **early-stage**, but evolving fast.
Designed to feel lightweight, responsive, and pleasant to use, like a browser made of water and glass.
